## 2. How Lkwiz-YT Works Using Falcon 180B with AI71 API

Lkwiz-YT enhances YouTube video comprehension through an interactive process that leverages advanced AI technology. Here's how it works:

### YouTube Video Link Submission

- Users provide the URL of the YouTube video they want to understand better.

### Extracting Video ID and Transcript

- The platform extracts the video ID from the URL.
- It retrieves the video's transcript text, ensuring the video has English captions.

### Using Falcon 180B with AI71 API

- The AI71 API, powered by Falcon 180B, processes the transcript to generate quiz questions and answers.
- This powerful AI model understands the context and details within the video, creating relevant and engaging quiz questions.

### Interactive Quizzes

- Users take the quiz to test their comprehension of the video's content.
- The AI generates multiple-choice questions, ensuring a diverse and thorough assessment.

### Chat Functionality

- Users can ask specific questions about the video's content.
- The AI71 API, with Falcon 180B, provides accurate and context-aware answers to enhance understanding.
